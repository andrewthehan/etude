- dynamics
- interval.isEnharmonic
- interval simple vs compound
- interval.inverse
- keysignature member fields is array of keys instead of key and quality
- modify a lot of methods in keysignature
- mode has ascending and descending
- add has apply(keysignature) method
- change policy to match changes to accidental
- optional<accidental>, remove accidental.none
- enum.size to optimize calls to enum.values().length
- move inversions into chords class
- chord streams
- make scale use pitch instead of key
- tempo string change
- value changes to allow for dotted types and tuplets
