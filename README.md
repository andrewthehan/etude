etude is a music theory library focused on the fundamentals of music.
 - **Deterministic**: All concepts covered by etude are outlined by nonrandom rules. This means etude cannot analyze a chord progression or develop a complex melody. However, it can tell you the pitches for a chord or the intervals between the notes of a melody.
 - **Immutable**: etude objects are not only immutable but also *strongly* immutable to enforce immutability with inheritance. You can learn about the benefits of immutability [here](https://github.com/facebook/immutable-js/#the-case-for-immutability).
 - **MIDI-compatible**: etude follows the [MIDI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIDI) standards.

**Requires Java 1.8.**
